## Hi there 👋, I'm Emmanuel Xavier

I am a software engineer, settled in Switzerland. You can find more about my professional career on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmanuelxavier040/). I have interests in ML/AI, therefore, I completed my Masters degree in Machine Intelligence at [Univeristy of Basel, Switzerland](https://www.unibas.ch/).

🔭 I’m currently working with SwissPost. One of my personal projects is design and development of a web-based multiplayer chess game, check it out [here](https://github.com/emmanuelxavier040/chess-app).

 Thanks for looking at my code 😊!
